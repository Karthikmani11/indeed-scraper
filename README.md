# Job Scraper

A simple web scraper for extracting job listings from Indeed using Selenium. The scraper retrieves job titles, companies, locations, post dates, summaries, and job URLs based on specified job positions and locations.

## Features

- Scrapes job listings from Indeed.
- Outputs results to a CSV file.
- Configurable for different job positions and locations.
- Handles pagination to scrape multiple pages of job listings.
- Logs errors encountered during scraping.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library
- Edge WebDriver (make sure it's compatible with your version of Microsoft Edge)
- An internet connection

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-scraper.git
   cd job-scraper
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. **Download the Edge WebDriver:**

   Ensure you have the Edge WebDriver installed and the path updated in the script where indicated. You can download it from [Microsoft's Edge WebDriver page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).

## Usage

1. **Open the script:**
   Modify the `main` function parameters to set the job position and location you wish to scrape. For example:

   ```python
   main('python developer', 'chennai', pages=2)
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python job_scraper.py
   ```

3. **Output:**
   The scraped job listings will be saved to `results.csv` in the same directory as the script. Check the log file `scraper_errors.log` for any errors encountered during scraping.

## Customization

You can customize the number of pages to scrape by changing the `pages` parameter in the `main` function.
